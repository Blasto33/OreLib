## OreLib: An ore library for modders ⛏️

Hi, Blasto here 👋

Welcome to my first mod ever: OreLib.

I initially decided to make this library to provide a stable foundation for modders. A lot of mods implement new ores to the game, sometimes the same ones multiple times. Back in the day, I was always annoyed to have 4 different ores in my inventory with the same name, such as Copper (before it was officially added to the game) or Tin Ore.

My goal is to make this mod used by a majority of modders, once it reaches a critical mass thanks to a vast ore catalog. I plan to add as many real and fictional ores as possible.

For now, OreLib should be as generic as possible so everyone is free to implement ores as they wish.

## **⚙️ How will it work?**
Once the core is completed, anyone will be able to open a pull request in order to add an ore to the lib.

It is planned to be as simple as possible: 
- 📋 Register your ore, using the name (an ore can only show up once so no duplicates)
- ➕ Add the textures you want to use, keeping the Vanilla atmosphere
- 🔓 Open a pull request
- 🤝 Create a new discussion so we can talk about it (optional but it's always nice to chat!) 
- ✅ Your ore has been added to the library, ready to be implemented!

## Can I join the project? 👉👈
Sure! Send me a message on Discord and let's talk about what you want to do!

What I'm currently looking for is artists or just motivated people to create new textures for the ores. For now, I'm creating them myself and even though I like doing it, they are not up to the level of quality I'm aiming for. After all, the goal is the library to be stable enough so anyone can use it out-of-the-box without hassle or friction.
